Jewel Warrior
=============

This is a coding exercise from the book [HTML5 Games: Creating FUN with HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL](http://www.javascriptgaming.com/). 

This is for now a skeleton. So far the code contains the following:

* the splash screen
* the main menu screen

The game logic now includes the following:

* dropping the jewels in the game screen initially 
* highlight/unhighlight jewel based on selection
* swapping only when there is a valid chain being formed 
* removal of the chains 
* dropping of the jewels from the cells above the chains (not adding new jewels yet) 

The code is currently not cross browser - it will only work in Chrome for now.
