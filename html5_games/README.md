Jewel Warrior
=============

This is a coding exercise from the book [HTML5 Games: Creating FUN with HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL](http://www.javascriptgaming.com/). 

This is for now a skeleton. So far the code contains the following:

* the splash screen
* the main menu screen

The game logic has not been implemented. 

The code is currently not cross browser - it will only work in Chrome for now.
